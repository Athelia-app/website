        <h1>Athelia Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective date: February 2026</strong><br>
            <strong>Last updated: February 2026</strong>
        </p>

        <p>Athelia (“App”) is developed by Mirror Atlas LLC (“Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). This Privacy Policy
            explains how we collect, use, disclose and safeguard your information when you use the App. It also
            describes your choices and rights regarding your personal data.</p>

        <p>Apple’s App Store policies require every iOS app to have a privacy policy that explains what data the app
            collects, how it collects data, how it uses data, how long it stores data, whether it shares data with third
            parties, and how users can revoke consent or request deletion. This Privacy Policy is designed to satisfy
            those requirements and applicable privacy laws.</p>

        <p>If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, do not use the App. By using the App, you consent
            to our data practices as described herein.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect the following categories of information:</p>

        <h3>1.1 Information You Provide to Us</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account, we collect your email address,
                password and other registration details.</li>
            <li><strong>Session Recordings:</strong> When you record a session of your social-media feed, the App
                captures content displayed on your screen (such as text, images, and interaction timestamps) to generate
                the session analysis.</li>
            <li><strong>Communications:</strong> If you contact us or participate in surveys, we collect the information
                you provide.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.2 Information We Collect Automatically</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Device and Usage Data:</strong> We automatically collect information about your device and how
                you use the App, such as device type, operating system, app version, IP address, timestamps, and event
                information (e.g., when you open the app, navigate to sections, or send messages).</li>
            <li><strong>Log Data:</strong> Our servers automatically record log data when you interact with the App.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.3 Information from Third Parties</h3>
        <p>We may receive information from service providers that help us deliver the App, such as analytics or
            error-reporting tools.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use your information for the following purposes:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Provide and Improve the Service:</strong> To operate, maintain and improve the App, generate
                session reports, respond to your questions and process transactions.</li>
            <li><strong>Personalise Your Experience:</strong> To customise the content and features based on your
                sessions and preferences.</li>
            <li><strong>Communicate with You:</strong> To send you updates, security alerts and support messages.</li>
            <li><strong>Analyse and Research:</strong> To understand usage patterns and improve performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Compliance and Protection:</strong> To comply with applicable laws, legal obligations and App
                Store requirements, enforce our Terms of Service, and protect the rights, property or safety of the
                Company, users or others.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>We do not use your data for tracking you across other apps or websites without your explicit permission, as
            required by Apple’s App Tracking Transparency policy.</p>

        <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
        <p>We may share your information as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We share information with vendors who perform services on our
                behalf, such as cloud hosting, analytics and customer support. We require them to protect your data and
                use it only for the purposes for which it was disclosed.</li>
            <li><strong>Third-Party AI Processing:</strong> When you use the chat feature, we send your session context
                and questions to OpenAI to generate responses. OpenAI processes the data under contractual safeguards
                and returns the reply. We do not allow OpenAI or any AI provider to use your data for training their
                models.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law or to protect our
                rights or the rights of others.</li>
            <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> If we are involved in a merger, acquisition or sale of assets, your
                information may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you if a different entity
                will handle your information.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>We do not sell or rent your personal data to third parties. We do not share your data for advertising or
            marketing purposes without your explicit consent.</p>

        <h2>4. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        <p>Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal data. These may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access:</strong> You can request a copy of the information we hold about you.</li>
            <li><strong>Correction:</strong> You can ask us to correct or update inaccurate or incomplete information.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can request deletion of your personal data. We will honour deletion
                requests unless we are required to retain data for legal or legitimate business purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>Objection:</strong> You can object to certain processing or ask us to restrict processing of
                your data.</li>
            <li><strong>Withdrawal of Consent:</strong> You can withdraw your consent at any time, including disabling
                session recording or closing your account.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To exercise these rights, please contact us using the information below. We may ask you to verify your
            identity to help us respond securely.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes described in this policy and our
            Terms of Service, or as required by law. Our Privacy Policy is required to explain data retention and
            deletion policies. After you delete your account, we will delete or anonymise your data, unless we are
            legally obliged to retain it.</p>

        <h2>6. Security</h2>
        <p>We implement technical and organisational measures designed to protect your information against unauthorised
            access, loss, misuse or alteration. These measures include encryption of data in transit, access controls,
            secure coding practices and regular security assessments. However, no method of transmission or storage is
            completely secure. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and
            immediately notifying us of any suspected unauthorised activity.</p>

        <h2>7. International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>We may store and process your information in the United States or other countries where our service providers
            operate. These countries may have different data protection laws from your country. We take steps to ensure
            that your personal data receives an adequate level of protection, including using standard contractual
            clauses or other approved mechanisms.</p>

        <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal data from
            children under 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal data without parental
            consent, we will delete it. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with
            personal data, please contact us.</p>

        <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes to our practices or for other
            operational, legal or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of material changes by posting the updated
            policy in the App and updating the “Last updated” date. Please review this policy periodically.</p>
