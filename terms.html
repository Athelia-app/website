        <h1>Athelia Terms of Service</h1>
        <p><strong>Last updated: February 2026</strong></p>

        <p>Welcome to Athelia (“App”). By downloading, accessing or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms
            of Service (“Terms”). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.</p>

        <p>The App is operated by Mirror Atlas LLC (“Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). These Terms govern your use of the
            App and form a binding agreement between you and the Company. You must be at least 13 years old (or the age
            of majority in your jurisdiction) to use the App. If you are under 18, you may use the App only with the
            consent of a parent or legal guardian.</p>

        <h2>1. Description of the Service</h2>
        <p>The App allows you to record a short session of your social-media feed (currently 10 minutes) and generates a
            report summarising the types of content you viewed. You can ask questions about each session via a built-in
            chat interface. The App provides insights for informational purposes only; it does not offer medical,
            psychological, legal or financial advice.</p>

        <h2>2. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By creating an account or using the App, you acknowledge that you have read, understood and agree to be bound
            by these Terms and our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated by reference. You must review both documents
            before using the App. We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will
            notify you via the App or other reasonable means. Your continued use of the App after an update constitutes
            acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

        <h2>3. Accounts and Eligibility</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Account Creation:</strong> You may be required to create an account to use certain features. You
                agree to provide accurate, complete and up-to-date information and to keep your credentials secure. You
                are responsible for all activities under your account. You may not share your account or permit others
                to use it.</li>
            <li><strong>Minimum Age:</strong> You must be at least 13 years old to create an account and use the App. If
                you are a parent or guardian permitting a minor to use the App, you agree to supervise their use and
                accept responsibility for their compliance with these Terms.</li>
            <li><strong>Account Termination:</strong> You may delete your account at any time through the settings menu.
                We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms or applicable laws. Upon
                termination, your licence to use the App ceases immediately, but sections that, by their nature, should
                survive termination will remain in effect.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>4. User Data and Privacy</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Data Collection and Use:</strong> We collect certain data to operate the App, including: (a)
                your account details (e.g., email address and password); (b) session recordings of your feed, including
                content, timestamps and interaction metrics; and (c) analytics such as device type and usage patterns.
                Our Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we collect it, and how we use it. In short, we use
                your data to generate session reports, provide chat responses, improve our services and comply with
                legal obligations. We only request data relevant to the core functionality of the App.</li>
            <li><strong>Third-Party Processing:</strong> We use third-party services (including OpenAI) to process
                session data and generate chat responses. These services have access only to the data necessary to
                provide their functions and must protect it consistent with these Terms and our Privacy Policy.</li>
            <li><strong>User Consent:</strong> By recording a session and using the chat, you consent to our collection
                and processing of the data described above. You may withdraw consent at any time by deleting your
                account or disabling session recording. The App provides clear purpose strings when requesting
                permissions (e.g., microphone or screen recording) and does not require data access unrelated to core
                features.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Retention and Deletion:</strong> We retain session data and chat transcripts only as long
                as necessary to provide the service and as described in our Privacy Policy. You may request deletion of
                your data at any time via account settings. We will delete or anonymise your data within a reasonable
                period.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Sharing and Tracking:</strong> We do not sell or rent your personal data. We do not track
                you across apps or websites for advertising without your explicit permission, and we comply with Apple’s
                App Tracking Transparency requirements. We may share aggregated or anonymised data that cannot be used
                to identify you.</li>
            <li><strong>Security:</strong> We implement technical and organisational measures designed to protect your
                data against unauthorised access, use or disclosure. However, no method of transmission or storage is
                completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. We encourage you to use strong passwords
                and to notify us immediately of any suspected breach.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>5. User Responsibilities and Prohibited Conduct</h2>
        <p>By using the App, you agree that you will not:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Upload, post or transmit illegal, harmful, offensive or infringing content.</li>
            <li>Harass, threaten, bully or otherwise harm other users.</li>
            <li>Use the App to collect data from others without their consent or in violation of privacy laws.</li>
            <li>Reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the App or attempt to access its source code.</li>
            <li>Use automated scripts, bots or scraping tools to access or interact with the App.</li>
            <li>Misrepresent your identity, impersonate others or create fake accounts.</li>
            <li>Interfere with or disrupt the App or servers, including by transmitting viruses or harmful code.</li>
            <li>Violate any applicable law or regulation.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>We reserve the right to investigate and take appropriate action, including removing content, suspending
            accounts, and reporting to law enforcement.</p>

        <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Our Content:</strong> The App, including its code, design, text, graphics and other content, is
                owned by the Company or its licensors and is protected by copyright, trademark and other intellectual
                property laws. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell or lease any part of the App without our prior
                written consent.</li>
            <li><strong>User Content:</strong> You retain ownership of any content you create through the App. By using
                the App, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free licence to use, host, store and display
                your content solely to operate and improve the App. You represent that you have the rights to grant this
                licence and that your content does not infringe any third-party rights.</li>
            <li><strong>Third-Party Content:</strong> The App may use content or libraries licensed from third parties.
                Such content is provided subject to the rights of the respective owners, and you agree to comply with
                any additional licence terms.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App may provide access to or integrate third-party services, such as AI platforms (e.g., OpenAI) and
            analytics providers. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of these services. Your use
            of third-party services is subject to their terms and policies. We encourage you to read their privacy
            policies before providing them with your data. These third parties are required to provide protections at
            least as protective as those in our own policies.</p>

        <h2>8. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p>The App and all content are provided “as is” and “as available” without warranty of any kind. To the extent
            permitted by law, we expressly disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to
            warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, accuracy and
            uninterrupted availability. We do not guarantee that the App will be error-free or that defects will be
            corrected.</p>
        <p>The insights provided by the App are for informational purposes only. We are not responsible for decisions or
            actions you take based on your use of the App or any information provided through the App.</p>

        <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers,
            employees and agents will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive
            damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data,
            use, goodwill or other intangible losses, resulting from (a) your use of or inability to use the App; (b)
            any unauthorised access to or use of our servers and/or any personal data; (c) any errors or omissions in
            the content; or (d) any conduct of any third party on the App.</p>
        <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation of liability for
            incidental or consequential damages. Accordingly, some of the above limitations may not apply to you. In no
            event will our total liability exceed the greater of one hundred U.S. dollars (US$100) or the amount you
            paid us to use the App in the twelve months preceding the claim.</p>

        <h2>10. Indemnity</h2>
        <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its affiliates from any claims, damages,
            liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to your use
            of the App, your violation of these Terms, or your violation of any rights of a third party.</p>

        <h2>11. Modifications to the Service</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify, suspend or discontinue the App (or any part of it) at any time with or
            without notice. We may also impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the App
            without notice or liability.</p>

        <h2>12. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Company is registered, without regard
            to its conflict of laws principles. Any disputes arising under or in connection with these Terms will be
            subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in that jurisdiction. Nothing herein will
            prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief.</p>

        <h2>13. Severability and Waiver</h2>
        <p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to
            the maximum extent permissible and the remaining provisions will remain in effect. Failure to enforce any
            provision will not constitute a waiver.</p>

        <h2>14. Additional Requirements for iOS Apps</h2>
        <p>These Terms are intended to comply with Apple’s App Store Review Guidelines and privacy requirements.
            Specifically:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We include a link to our Privacy Policy in the App’s settings and on the App Store listing.</li>
            <li>We clearly identify the data we collect, how we collect it and all uses of that data, including
                retention and deletion policies.</li>
            <li>We secure user consent for data collection and provide an easy way to withdraw consent.</li>
            <li>We minimise the data we request and only collect what is necessary for the core functionality of the
                App.</li>
            <li>We disclose any sharing of personal data with third-party services and require them to provide equal
                protection of user data.</li>
            <li>We allow users to delete their accounts and associated data within the App.</li>
            <li>We comply with App Tracking Transparency requirements and do not track users without their permission.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If any portion of these Terms conflicts with Apple’s App Store Review Guidelines, those Guidelines will
            govern to the extent of the conflict.</p>
